## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn how to design a webpage using only CSS and HTML. The goal is to create a webpage that has the same layout as a given static comp, though creativity with the copy, images, icons, and color palette is allowed.


## Basic Requirements
- Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css
- Site must be responsive
- Create a repo on github for the work with a specific, given naming construct.
- Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and the created version.
- Push all final work to github pages


## Learning

- Create a webpage without given assets or native files.
- Use HTML to create the content of a webpage.
- Use CSS to design the layout of a webpage.
- Make a webpage responsive and accessible.

## Learning Opportunities

- found new online resources that compliment my learning style
- learned how to add transition on hover
- learned how to use flexbox
- can now target specific elements more efficiently
- implemented new time management skills
- finished the project before due time, allowing me to reach out to my mentor with questions
- had extra time to help others


## Sample Images

### A static comp was given. The goal is to create a webpage with the same layout.


### I created a wireframe to plan out the components of the page.



### I combined the layout of the given static comp with my love of comic books. Here, I can designed a fiction-inspired webpage that can be used to hire the hero of your choice. Each profile gives the hero's name, experience, teams, and hero type, as well as a user input box that could be used (with the help of Javascript which was not used in this project per instructions) to send an inquiry to your hero.


### Hover effects give the user a clear understanding of what parts of the site can be interacted with. In the screenshots below, there are examples of how each component responds to the hover interaction.


### Hyperlinks are used throughout the webpage, with the most apparent being the menu at the top. Learn, read, and write all redirect the user to outside sites in a new window. The user can learn about various heroes, read their stories, and even watch videos that cover the heroes' history.


### The Admin Login redirects the user to an outside login page.


### Each hero's profile box has a white user icon in the top left corner of thier picture. By clicking on this picture, the user can read a complete history of that hero.


### The site is responsive and can be used on computers, tablets, and phones. Here is a view of the site on an iPhone X.
